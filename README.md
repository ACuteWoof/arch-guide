## arch linux installation guide

Arch linux's official installation guide can be quite hard to follow for a beginner linux user. <br>
The information is spread across multiple pages that can make the installation process quite strenuous. <br>
So I made this guide keeping the language as simple as possible for anyone willing to install arch linux. <br>
Happy journey ahead !
